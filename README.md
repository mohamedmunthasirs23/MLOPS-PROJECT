# ðŸ“„ Loan Default Risk Monitoring System

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
The Loan Default Risk Monitoring System uses machine learning models to predict the probability of loan defaults and monitors customer risk distribution through real-time dashboards. This system empowers financial institutions to make informed lending decisions, reduce defaults, and manage regional risks effectively.

---

## ðŸ§  Key Features
- Loan default prediction using machine learning algorithms.
- Borrower risk classification into Low, Medium, and High categories.
- Real-time Grafana dashboards for live monitoring.
- Visualization of approval trends and regional risk heatmaps.
- Data storage using **MySQL database**.

---

## ðŸš€ Tech Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Matplotlib
- **Database**: MySQL
- **Visualization Tool**: Grafana
- **Deployment (Optional)**: Docker
